# 1 **Introduction**

Write an introduction of your project.

TaskPlanner project is a desktop application developed with a GUI by using swing library of Java which aims organizing the tasks in the user's daily life and job. The user and the data is stored in a MySQL database. This project aims to provide an efficient and organized way for the user to manage their tasks and enhance their productivity.

# 2 **Requirements Definition**

No explanation is needed here. Only complete the subsections.

## 2.1 **Functional Requirements**

Write all the functional requirements in your project.

-The user should be able to login to the system by entering their username and password.

-The system allows user create an account by clicking "Create Account" button on the LoginFrame. Then user will be redirected to create account frame so can enter their username and password.

-The user should be able to create a new task by filling in the required fields (Task Name, Short Description, Deadline, Priority, and Reminder Image) and clicking the "Insert task" button. The task should be saved to the database with an automatically assigned ID and entry date.

-The user should be able to view a list of all tasks in the database by clicking the "Show all tasks" button.

-The user should be able to select a task from the table view and delete it by clicking the "Delete task" button.

-The system should have "Update task" option that allows user to edit the tasks. The system will also update the database.

-The user should be able to select a task from the table view and view its associated image (if it has one) in a new frame.

-The system should have "Sort by priority" button to view a list of tasks with given deadline sorted by priority.

-The system should have use the "Filter tasks" button to view a list of tasks with deadlines within given date range.-Once the user is logged in, they should receive a notification message for tasks that have one day left to their deadlines. This information should be pulled from the database.

## 2.2 **Nonfunctional Requirements**

Write 5 nonfunctional requirements that can be suitable for your project.

-The system shall have interface easy to navigate, requiring no more than few minutes for new users.

-The system should be designed that is allowing the adding of new features or functionalities without changing existing code.

-The system should be designed in a way that makes it easy to adapt for different operating systems.

-The system interface should be user friendly. The text should be readable and the components should be aligned.

-The system should ensure to prevent unauthorized access to protect against common security threats.

# 3 **Use Case Analysis**

No explanation is needed here. Only complete the subsections.

## 3.1 **Actors**

Write and describe each actor.

**User:** User is the main actor of the system and can interact with various functionalities. User can login to the sytem by entering his/her username and password, create another account and perform activities such as insert, view, delete, update and filter a task. The user gives inputs to the system by using interface (GUI) components and gives output as updated data or notifications. The User's specific data about task is stored in the database.

**Database:** The database of the "TaskPlanner" system stores user information and task details.

**Scenarios**

Write 2 sample use case scenarios that can occur in your project.

**Use Case Scenario 1:** Inserting a New Task

**Actor:** User

When the user launches the "TaskPlanner" application, he or she logs in using his/her username and password. The user is presented with the MainFrame of the system, which displays various task management options. After that user fills in the required text fields (name, description, deadline, and reminder image) and optionally provides a priority value and user clicks the "Insert a task" button. Then the application validates the input and checks for any missing or invalid data. If all required fields are filled and the data is valid, the application inserts the task into the database with an automatically assigned ID and entry date. The application confirms the successful insertion of the task and updates the task list table on the MainFrame to show the newly added task.

**Use Case Scenario 2:** Viewing a Task Image

**Actor:** User

Firstly, user logs in to the "TaskPlanner" application then user navigates to the MainFrame, where a list of tasks is displayed. The user selects a task from the list that has a reminder image associated with it. The user clicks on the "View Reminder Image" button. After that the application checks if the selected task has a reminder image associated with it. If the task has an image, the system opens a new frame to display the image so the user can view the image, which provides visual information related to the task. But if the task does not have an associated image, the application displays a message box labeled that the task does not have an reminder image. The User can close the image frame and continue to perform different actions within the system.

# 8 **Conclusion and Future Work**

Write a conclusion for your project and summarize your work. Also write what kind of features/functions can be added to your project.

Firstly, users can add, edit and delete their own tasks with this app. To do this, they need to create an account. After that, they will need to choose a name and deadline for the task they want to add. In addition, users will get notified about the tasks that have most one day left. Users can also filter and sort their tasks by using this app which will make it easier to see what should they do first. In short, users can easily arrange their tasks with this app and make their life easier.

In the future, customization options and selecting an image when inserting a task may be added for the table. Also more notification options may be added to the project.
